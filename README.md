## This is my Java Language Introduction

Be aware that this is only the introduction to the language itself, without any kind of frameworks or tools.
This repository is not made for running. It is a form of learning and documenting my studies on Java language.

## --- Studies Documentation ---

This introduction to Java not only is helpful to understand the syntax of the language, but also serves as a method of reminding everything that will be learned. 
Repository creation: June 11th 2025
This Introduction includes:
- A theory directory
- A practice directory

Inside the theory directory, all the fundamentals and learning are documented, they include:
- Variables, conditional structures, introductory Functions such as "println", repetition/loop Structures.
- Functions, methods, overloaded methods, variable arguments and procedures.
- Arrays, array lists, lists and hashmaps.
- String manipulation.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP), objects and constructors.
- etc.

And inside the practice one, all the projects, algorithms and data structures made will await. They include:
- Algorithms such as: binary search, selection sort and quick sort.
- Data structures such as HashMaps(once again).
- Some small projects of mine.
